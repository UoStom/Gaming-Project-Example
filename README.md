# Gaming-Project-Example

This is a Read Me file explaining what files I have in this Project. 

You can use a read me file to help provide instructions on how to use your game.

Make sure you store all the files related to your game in your repository so that they can be accessed and assessed. 

Remember, each game will be assessed on three key criteria which are important to consider in any coding project:

1) Originality 

As we have mentioned before, we want this to be your own code, but also try to come up with your own ideas - make it as innovative as possible! There is no problem taking inspiration from other games or trying to make similar games to existing ones, but the best games will be those who involve some novelty. 

2) Complexity 

We've learnt a lot over the past few weeks and this is the opportunity to show off that you've mastered it all! Whilst you can submit any sort of game, whether it be text-based or more visual, we want to see what you can do with what you learnt and for that reason, the more complex the game, the higher the mark. We want to see you try to use everything you've learnt from the programme to make an awesome game! 

3) Readability 

Whilst we want you to try and use some of the more difficult concepts in your game, a really important thing when writing code is that it is readable, meaning it's accessible to other programmers and developers. For this reason, we want to see clean code, with explanatory notes explaining what your code is doing (use comments). This is a really good practice if you continue in this profession and is a good habit to get into.


Each of these criteria will be marked out of a total of 10 points, meaning each game will be scored out of a maximum of 30 points.
